What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/peak_fifo_mode_enable
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute allows to configure the FIFO to store sample
		sets of impact event peak (x, y, z). As a precondition, all
		three channels (x, y, z) need to be enabled.
		Writing 1, peak fifo mode will be enabled, if cleared and
		all three channels are enabled, sample sets of concurrent
		3-axis data will be stored in the FIFO.
